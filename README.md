# ECE 5020: Digital Signal Processing

This course was added late per the recommendation of my advisor @ Tennessee Tech for the Spring 2026 semester. I will be taking this class on TR from 12:00-1:00 PM CST and will be used as one of the final courses for my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Tennessee Technological University.


**Instructor Course Description**: Advances in digital hardware such as
computers and chips have made digital processing systems ubiquitous in our highly technological
environment. Such systems are capable of performing complex signal processing tasks more reliably,
flexibly, precisely, and less expensively compared to their analog counterparts. Digital signal
processing (DSP) systems are the enabling technology for numerous innovations including smart
phones, medical equipment, aerospace, communication, and robotics applications and yet they are
often hidden to the end user. ECE 4020/5020: Digital Signal Processing is an introductory course that
introduces the fundamental concepts and tools used in the analysis and design of most commonly
employed DSP systems. While the subject has solid mathematical foundations (signals and systems
theory), the objective of this course is to equip the students with the ability to analyze and relate to
many real-world DSP applications.

**Course Description**: Theory and practice of discrete-time signals and systems, A/D and D/A conversion, filter design, DSP Architecture and implementation, programming, DSP applications.
